Here's how I would structure a prompt to get an AI to generate a User Service following the same pattern:

"Please create a User Service (services/user.service.ts) following the same pattern as the provided Community Service. The service should integrate with cache, events, and the user repository.

Here's my User model from Prisma:
```prisma
model User {
    id            String          @id
    appWallet     String          @unique
    username      String          @unique
    extWallet     String          @unique
    email         String?         @unique
    bio           String?
    website       String?
    avatarUrl     String?
    bannerUrl     String?
    profile       Profile?
    communities   UserCommunity[]
    projects      Project[]
    posts         Post[]
    comments      Comment[]
    votes         Vote[]
    roles         UserRole[]
    roleGrants    RoleGrant[]     @relation('grantor')
    tokens        UserToken[]
}
```

Requirements:
1. Follow the same structure as CommunityService with:
   - Repository dependency
   - Cache service integration
   - Event emitter for notifications
   - Error handling
   - Cache invalidation

2. Implement these methods:
   - createUser
   - getUser (with cache)
   - updateUser (with cache invalidation)
   - deleteUser
   - getUserByWallet
   - getUserByUsername
   - getUserProfile (with related data)
   - getUserCommunities
   - getUserRoles
   - searchUsers

3. Include proper:
   - Type definitions
   - Constructor injection
   - Cache key patterns
   - Event emissions
   - Error handling
   - Documentation

4. Maintain consistency with:
   - Cache strategies
   - Event naming
   - Error handling patterns
   - Method signatures

Please follow the same patterns shown in the community service example, particularly for cache and event handling."

This prompt provides:
1. Clear context (existing service example)
2. Model definition
3. Specific requirements
4. Expected methods
5. Integration points
6. Patterns to follow
